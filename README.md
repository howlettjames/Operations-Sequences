# Basic Operations with Sequences

### Project for the subject Signals and Communication Theory.

Through representation of discrete signals with arrays we can perform several operations over them. For example: convolution, amplification, interpolation, etc.

This program was implemented in Java. The UI was programmed using the JavaFX library.
